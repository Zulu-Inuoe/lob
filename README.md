# lob
A command-line build tool for Common Lisp

## Why

I've found myself writing similar tools in various projects and I think it's time I dedicate more time and make it a bit more robust.

## Status

Ultra Alpha

# Other Projects

You're likely better off using one of these instead, which do similar (and far more) of the same:

* [BuildApp](https://github.com/xach/buildapp)
* [Roswell](https://github.com/roswell/roswell)
