     "Operate does mainly four things for the user:

1. Resolves the OPERATION designator into an operation object.
   OPERATION is typically a symbol denoting an operation class, instantiated with MAKE-OPERATION.
2. Resolves the COMPONENT designator into a component object.
   COMPONENT is typically a string or symbol naming a system, loaded from disk using FIND-SYSTEM.
3. It then calls MAKE-PLAN with the operation and system as arguments.
4. Finally calls PERFORM-PLAN on the resulting plan to actually build the system.

The entire computation is wrapped in WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT and error handling code.
If a VERSION argument is supplied, then operate also ensures that the system found satisfies it
using the VERSION-SATISFIES method.
If a PLAN-CLASS argument is supplied, that class is used for the plan.
If a PLAN-OPTIONS argument is supplied, the options are passed to the plan.

The :FORCE or :FORCE-NOT argument to OPERATE can be:
  T to force the inside of the specified system to be rebuilt (resp. not),
    without recursively forcing the other systems we depend on.
  :ALL to force all systems including other systems we depend on to be rebuilt (resp. not).
  (SYSTEM1 SYSTEM2 ... SYSTEMN) to force systems named in a given list
:FORCE-NOT has precedence over :FORCE; builtin systems cannot be forced.

For backward compatibility, all keyword arguments are passed to MAKE-OPERATION
when instantiating a new operation, that will in turn be inherited by new operations.
But do NOT depend on it, for this is deprecated behavior."))

        ~:[(and older than 2.27 at that)~;~:*~A~] registered at ~S. ~
        Having an ASDF installed and registered is the normal way of configuring ASDF to upgrade itself, ~
        and having an old version registered is a configuration error. ~
        ASDF will ignore this configured system rather than downgrade itself. ~
        In the future, you may want to either: ~
        (a) upgrade this configured ASDF to a newer version, ~
        (b) install a newer ASDF and register it in front of the former in your configuration, or ~
        (c) uninstall or unregister this and any other old version of ASDF from your configuration. ~
        Note that the older ASDF might be registered implicitly through configuration inherited ~
        from your system installation, in which case you might have to specify ~
        :ignore-inherited-configuration in your in your ~~/.config/common-lisp/source-registry.conf ~
        or other source-registry configuration file, environment variable or lisp parameter. ~
        Indeed, a likely offender is an obsolete version of the cl-asdf debian or ubuntu package, ~
        that you might want to upgrade (if a recent enough version is available) ~
        or else remove altogether (since most implementations ship with a recent asdf); ~
        if you lack the system administration rights to upgrade or remove this package, ~
        then you might indeed want to either install and register a more recent version, ~
        or use :ignore-inherited-configuration to avoid registering the old one. ~
